# Learn C++ for Game Development Course

I created this repository for my work in the [Learn C++ for Game Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-cpp-for-ue4-unit-1/) course I took from Stephen Ulibarri Druid Mechanics.

# Lesson Notes

## Overview of Computers

+ **Programs:** Set of instructions.
+ **Software:** A collection of programs.
+ **Hardware:** Actual physical machines.

_Input Devices (Mouse, Keyboard, Microphone) -> CPU & Main Memory & Secondary Memory -> Output Devices (Monitor, Speakers)_

+ **Main Memory:** A long list of memory locations (RAM)

**Binary Digit (bit):** 0 or 1
**Byte:** 8-bit portion of memory
**Memory Location:** Contain 8 (or some multiple of 8) bits

+ **Secondary Memory:** Permanent Storage (Hard Drive)
+ **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The "brain" of computers, carries out instructions

**High Level Programming Languages**
+ C++, C, C#, Python, PHP, Java, etc.

**Low Level Programming Languages**
+ Assembly Language (ADD X Y Z)
+ Machine Language (0110 1001 1010 1011)

**Compiler:** Translates your code to machine language
**Linker:** Combines your code with any pre-made routines

_Your Code -> Compiler -> Machine Language_

+ **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Software application that provides...
    + Source code editor
    + Build automation tools
    + Debugger
    + Example: Visual Studio
